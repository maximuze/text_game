This is a text-based adventure game (or, interactive fiction, as it is sometimes called)
written in the Ruby language.

Featuring branching paths (depending on the choices you make), stealth, action, traps,
and plot twists, this is what you would get if you were to combine Choose Your Own Adventure 
with Metal Gear Solid.
