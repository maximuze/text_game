This is a text-based adventure game (or, interactive fiction, as it is sometimes called)
written in the Ruby programming language.

Featuring branching paths (depending on the choices you make), stealth, action, traps, 
randomly-generated codes to crack, and plot twists, this is what you would get if you 
were to combine Choose Your Own Adventure with Metal Gear Solid.

I will be refactoring the code and possibly adding more to the game, depending on the
feedback I get from people. In the meanwhile, please enjoy this gripping tale of 
espionage and treachery, where the choices you make can either lead you to doom, or help
you uncover a conspiracy that threatens to unravel the very fabric of human society!
